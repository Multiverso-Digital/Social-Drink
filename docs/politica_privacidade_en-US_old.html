        <BR>

the transmission of the information described below. For more information about these features,<br>
see the Windows Phone 7 Privacy Statement available at http://www.windowsphone.com/privacy.<br>

Authenticity label with a genuine copy of the software identifies licensed software. To be valid, this label<br>

15. RESTRICTED USE.<br>

losses; or<br>
&#61623; Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.<br>
